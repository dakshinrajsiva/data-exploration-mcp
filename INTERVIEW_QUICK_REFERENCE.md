## üéØ **Common Interview Questions & Answers**

### **Q: "How does the MCP protocol work?"**
**A**: *"MCP uses JSON-RPC over stdio for bidirectional communication. Claude Desktop launches my Python server as a subprocess, establishes stdin/stdout channels, and exchanges structured messages. The server registers 28 tools dynamically, receives tool calls with parameters, processes data locally, and returns structured results."*

### **Q: "How do you ensure data privacy?"**
**A**: *"I designed a privacy-first architecture where raw data never leaves the local machine. The MCP server processes data locally and only sends statistical summaries to the LLM. PII and sensitive information stays protected while still enabling AI-augmented insights."*

### **Q: "What makes your solution production-ready?"**
**A**: *"Three key factors: Performance optimization with 337x speed improvement, robust error handling with graceful degradation, and quantified business impact with $13,824 annual ROI. The system handles enterprise-scale datasets with sub-50ms response times."*

### **Q: "How did you achieve such significant performance improvements?"**
**A**: *"Two main optimizations: Memory optimization through intelligent dtype selection (67% reduction) and vectorization replacing traditional loops (337x faster). For example, converting int64 to uint8 where appropriate saves 87.5% memory, and using NumPy vectorized operations instead of pandas iterrows provides massive speed improvements."*
